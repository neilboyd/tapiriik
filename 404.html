    <p>
        This site was an attempt to run a clone of
        <a href="https://tapiriik.com/">tapiriik</a>
        because that has stopped working
        <a href="https://github.com/cpfair/tapiriik/issues">reliably</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        I <a href="https://github.com/neilboyd/tapiriik">clone</a>d it,
        converted it to run on Kubernetes,
        added a service to
        <a href="https://github.com/cpfair/tapiriik/pull/554">sync to MapMyFitness</a>,
        and had it running on this site.
    </p>
    <p>
        But I realised that the code base is very old,
        most of the services are old and don't support their API's any more,
        and I don't like <a href="https://www.python.org/">Python</a> very much,
        and so it wasn't worth me spending money to run this service.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you're looking for an alternative,
        I would suggest
        <a href="https://www.fitnesssyncer.com/">FitnessSyncer</a>.
